An intel 8080 emulator built in rust to play games such as space invaders.

The aim is to get engagement from people of all levels to help eachother out and learn together!

Feel free to pull and contribute as much or as little as you like.

I think learning together is an excellent way to learn and progress so join in and lets build stuff!!

The docs I found for opcodes are these 2:
http://www.emulator101.com/reference/8080-by-opcode.html
https://tobiasvl.github.io/optable/intel-8080/

There is also this scanned copy of the assembly programming manual for the 8080. Has lots of good info
