An intel 8080 emulator built in rust to play games such as space invaders. 

I want to test the waters with this project and if we can get enough engagement I plan to set up a dedicated account dedicated to building emulators in Rust as a way to learn the language and just learn more about the nitty gritty of how computers work. 

This could also be a good opportunity to bring some people together and make other projects in teams. As we all know, the only way to learn is to just build!

The language of choice is Rust. I love it and I think it has a great future. I really don't think the learning curve is as steep as some people make out and it has some excellent features. Also, cargo is by far the easiest package manager I have ever used. 

Feel free to pull and contribute as much or as little as you like.

Never used rust? Have a look through the rust book.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

The book can be a bit overwhelming at first but the things covered in this emulator are pretty basic so you don't need to worry too much about working through the whole book. Just enough to get an idea of the syntax and how data types are used. 

I'm more than happy to explain things you dont understand but bear in mind I'm a begginer myself so there is only so much I understand.

The docs I found for the 8080 opcodes are:
http://www.emulator101.com/reference/8080-by-opcode.html

There is also this scanned copy of the assembly programming manual for the 8080. Has lots of good info
